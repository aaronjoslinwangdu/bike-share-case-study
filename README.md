# Divvy Case Study

For this case study I am going to be analyzing data from [Divvy,](https://www.divvybikes.com) a bike share program based in Chicago. The datasets I used are public and can be found in the [Archive](https://github.com/aaronjoslinwangdu/bike-share-case-study/tree/master/Archive), as well as [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
