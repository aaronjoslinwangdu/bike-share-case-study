# Introduction

For this case study I am going to be analyzing data from [Divvy,](https://www.divvybikes.com) a bike share program based in Chicago. Divvy has a fleet of nearly 6,000 bicycles which are geotracked and rode within a network of 692 stations throughout Chicago. This case study was my Capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, and was done entirely in RStudio.
