# Introduction

For this case study I am going to be analyzing data from [Divvy,](https://www.divvybikes.com) a bike share program based in Chicago. Divvy has a fleet of nearly 6,000 bicycles which are geotracked and rode within a network of 692 stations throughout Chicago. 

## What is the point of this case study?

The questions that I am using to quide my study are:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Divvy annual membership?

## The Data

The datasets I used are public and can be found in the [Archive](https://github.com/aaronjoslinwangdu/bike-share-case-study/tree/master/Archive), as well as [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
