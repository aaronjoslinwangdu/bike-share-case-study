## What is the point of this case study?

The questions used to guide this case study are:\
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Divvy bikes differently?\
2. How can Divvy influence casual riders to become members?

## The Data

The datasets used in this case study are public and can be found in the [Archive folder](https://github.com/aaronjoslinwangdu/bike-share-case-study/tree/master/Archive), as well as [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

## Preparation and Cleaning

First, install and load all of the necessary packages for preparing and cleaning the data.

```{r loadlib, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse",repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')
install.packages("janitor",repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')
install.packages("lubridate",repos = 'http://cran.us.r-project.org')
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(scales)
```

Then, import all of the .csv files, add them to separate dataframes, and combine them into one dataframe called **bike_rides**.

```{r import,results="hide"}
df1 <- read.csv("./Data/202004-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df2 <- read.csv("./Data/202005-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df3 <- read.csv("./Data/202006-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df4 <- read.csv("./Data/202007-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df5 <- read.csv("./Data/202008-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df6 <- read.csv("./Data/202009-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df7 <- read.csv("./Data/202010-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df8 <- read.csv("./Data/202011-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df9 <- read.csv("./Data/202012-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df10 <- read.csv("./Data/202101-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df11 <- read.csv("./Data/202102-divvy-tripdata.csv")
df12 <- read.csv("./Data/202103-divvy-tripdata.csv")

bike_rides <- rbind(df1,df2,df3,df4,df5,df6,df7,df8,df9,df10,df11,df12)
```

The first step taken to clean the data was removing any empty rows or columns from **bike_rides**.

```{r remove_empty}
bike_rides <- janitor::remove_empty(bike_rides,which = c("cols"))
bike_rides <- janitor::remove_empty(bike_rides,which = c("rows"))
```

Since the **started_at** and **ended_at** columns represent dates, convert them into the correct data type.

```{r convert_ymd_hms}
bike_rides$started_at <- lubridate::ymd_hms(bike_rides$started_at)
bike_rides$ended_at <- lubridate::ymd_hms(bike_rides$ended_at)
```

Use the **started_at** and **ended_at** columns to create separate columns for the day of the week, starting hour, month, etc. that each trip occurred on.

```{r separate_time_cols}
bike_rides$start_hour <- lubridate::hour(bike_rides$started_at)
bike_rides$end_hour <- lubridate::hour(bike_rides$ended_at)

bike_rides$date <- as.Date(bike_rides$started_at)
bike_rides$end_date <- as.Date(bike_rides$ended_at)

bike_rides$month <- format(as.Date(bike_rides$date),"%m")
bike_rides$day <- format(as.Date(bike_rides$date),"%d")
bike_rides$year <- format(as.Date(bike_rides$date),"%Y")
bike_rides$day_of_week <- format(as.Date(bike_rides$date),"%A")
```

Add a column representing the duration of each trip in seconds, then change it to the correct data type.

```{r difftime}
bike_rides$ride_length_seconds <- difftime(bike_rides$ended_at,bike_rides$started_at)
bike_rides$ride_length_seconds <- as.numeric(as.character(bike_rides$ride_length_seconds))
```

It was specified by the source that certain data was faulty/irrelevant, so that data should be removed as well as negative/extremely high values for **ride_length_seconds**. Then, create a separate, final dataframe called **bike_rides_v2**.

```{r create_bike_rides_v2}
bike_rides_v2 <- bike_rides[!(bike_rides$start_station_name == "HQ QR" | bike_rides$ride_length_seconds<0 | bike_rides$ride_length_seconds>604800),]
```

Finally, correct the order of the days of the week so the visualization labels would be more intuitive.

```{r order_days}
bike_rides_v2$day_of_week <- ordered(bike_rides_v2$day_of_week, levels=c("Sunday","Monday","Tuesday","Wednesday","Thursday","Friday","Saturday"))
```


List all of the column names for clarity.

```{r colnames}
colnames(bike_rides_v2)
```

## Analysis

First, check how many total rides members and casual users took throughout the whole time period.

```{r total_rides_mem_vs_cas}
bike_rides_v2 %>% 
  count(member_casual)
```

Now check the number of total rides per month for each group.

```{r per_month}
bike_rides_v2 %>% 
  count(month,member_casual)
```

Check the mean, median, max, min of **ride_length_seconds**.

```{r summary}
summary(bike_rides_v2$ride_length_seconds)
```

Compare the above measures between members and casual users.

```{r aggregate_mem_vs_cas}
setNames(aggregate(bike_rides_v2$ride_length_seconds ~ bike_rides_v2$member_casual, FUN = mean),c("Membership Type","Mean Ride Length (seconds)"))
setNames(aggregate(bike_rides_v2$ride_length_seconds ~ bike_rides_v2$member_casual, FUN = median),c("Membership Type","Median Ride Length (seconds)"))
setNames(aggregate(bike_rides_v2$ride_length_seconds ~ bike_rides_v2$member_casual, FUN = max),c("Membership Type","Max Ride Length (seconds)"))
setNames(aggregate(bike_rides_v2$ride_length_seconds ~ bike_rides_v2$member_casual, FUN = min),c("Membership Type","Min Ride Length (seconds)"))
```

Find the average ride time by each day for members vs. casuals.

```{r ride_time_per_day_mem_vs_cas}
setNames(aggregate(bike_rides_v2$ride_length_seconds ~ bike_rides_v2$member_casual + bike_rides_v2$day_of_week, FUN = mean),c("Membership Type","Weekday","Avg. Daily Ride (seconds)"))
```

Analyze ridership data by type and weekday.

```{r weekday_type}
bike_rides_v2 %>% 
  mutate(weekday = wday(started_at,label = TRUE)) %>%  #creates weekday field using wday()
  group_by(member_casual,weekday) %>%  #groups by user type and weekday
  summarize(number_of_rides = n(), average_duration = mean(ride_length_seconds)) %>%  #calculations
  arrange(weekday)  
```

Check how many trips there are each day with each type of bike for members vs. casuals.

```{r bike_type}
bike_rides_v2 %>% 
  count(member_casual,day_of_week, rideable_type)
```

Check how the times that casuals/members start trips are different.

```{r start_time_diffs}
bike_rides_v2 %>% 
  count(member_casual,start_hour)

```


## Visualizations

![avg_duration_per_day](https://github.com/aaronjoslinwangdu/bike-share-case-study/blob/master/Visualizations/avg_duration_per_day.png)

From this visualization we can clearly see that casual Divvy users ride over two times longer on average compared to users with memberships.

&nbsp;


![number_of_rides_by_rider_type](https://github.com/aaronjoslinwangdu/bike-share-case-study/blob/master/Visualizations/number_of_rides_by_rider_type.png)

By looking at this chart we can observe a few things. First off, both casual users and members use docked bikes much more than the other two available types. Also, the number of rides per day for members does not vary heavily throughout the week, with only a slight increase as the week progresses.
Lastly, we can see that casual users ride much more often on weekends, especially Saturday.

&nbsp;


![rides_every_hour](https://github.com/aaronjoslinwangdu/bike-share-case-study/blob/master/Visualizations/rides_every_hour.png)

Here we can see that the number of trips that members take spike at 8am and 6pm, while the casual riders steadily increase the amount of trips that they take throughout the day.

## Difficulties

Some shortcomings in this case study include:\
  1. Didn't analyze the length of rides in terms of distance.\
  2. Didn't include analysis done on starting/ending stations since it was inconclusive.\
  3. Hourly ride visual was not as clear as intended.
  
Steps being taken to fix these shortcomings:\
  1. Perform further analysis on differences between casual/member ride distances.\
  2. Test different methods of analysis using starting/ending station data.\
  3. Improve plotting methods for the "Rides Every Hour" visual.

## Conclusion

From the analysis and visualizations the most insightful information gained from this dataset can be condensed into a few key observations.

These key observations are:\
  1. Casual riders ride more often on the weekend than during the week.\
  2. Casual riders on average take longer lasting trips than members.\
  3. The number of rides by casual riders surpasses the number of rides by members on Saturday.\
  4. Members use their bikes often around 8am and 6pm, possibly indicating using Divvy services for work transportation.\
  
My recommendations for Divvy based on these observations are:\
  1. Creating an alternate membership type that caters toward weekend users.\
  2. Advertising Divvy as an alternative to driving your car to work.
